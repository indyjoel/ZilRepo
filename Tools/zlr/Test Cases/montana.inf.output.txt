Shrine
After rescuing that jungle princess, decoding the treasure map you found, and fighting off those rabid jaguars as you made your way through the rainforest, your well-deserved reward is at hand.

You can see a pedestal (on which is a golden idol) here.

You remember the princess's warning, quickly drop to one knee, and just barely avoid the poison dart aimed for your head. Heaving a sigh of relief, you stick the idol in your knapsack and head back to the museum.
