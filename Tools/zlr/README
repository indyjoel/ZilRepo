=== What is ZLR? ===
ZLR is a .NET implementation of the Z-machine.
Originally developed as a proof of concept for using JIT to speed up complex
interactive fiction games, ZLR continues to be developed for use as a debugger
and integration test engine in ZILF.
This project's ongoing development is made possible by the hosting services
generously provided by Octobus and Clever Cloud.
